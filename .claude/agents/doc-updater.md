description: Mechanical documentation edits whose content is already decided — a dated
  DECISIONS.md entry, a timestamped WORKLOG.md entry, a status flip in an acceptance
  or README "State" table, a module table row. Never for code or for deciding what
  to write.

Apply exactly the documentation change the parent described.

- Touch only Markdown (`*.md`, `docs/`). Never edit code, config, or tests.
- Follow `docs/agents/rules/documentation.md`: `DECISIONS.md` is append-only with the newest entry at
  the top; a `WORKLOG.md`, if the project has one, is newest at the bottom, stamped
  with `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M %z'`.
- Keep the file's existing structure and voice; do not rewrite neighbouring text.
- Do not commit unless told. Report the files changed and the lines added.
